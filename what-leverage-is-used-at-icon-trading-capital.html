        <p>At Icon Trading Capital, leverage plays a crucial role in amplifying your trading potential. We offer different leverage options depending on the type of account you hold. Understanding the leverage associated with your account can help you manage your trades more effectively and optimize your trading strategy.</p>
        <br class="mobile-br">
        <h2>1. Leverage for Welcome and Start-Up Accounts</h2>
        <p>If you hold a Welcome or Start-Up account, you benefit from a leverage of <strong>1:200</strong>. This level of leverage allows you to control a larger position with a relatively small amount of capital, providing the opportunity for increased trading flexibility and potential returns.</p>
        <br class="mobile-br">

        <h2>2. Leverage for Rapid and Stellar Accounts</h2>
        <p>For those with Rapid or Stellar accounts, the leverage offered is significantly higher at <strong>1:2000</strong>. This higher leverage provides even greater control over larger trading positions, but it also requires careful risk management to avoid substantial losses.</p>
        <br class="mobile-br">
        <h2>3. Managing Leverage Effectively</h2>
        <p>While higher leverage can amplify your gains, it also increases the potential risk. Itâ€™s essential to use leverage wisely and implement effective risk management strategies to protect your capital. Adjusting your position sizes and using stop-loss orders are crucial practices for managing risk in leveraged trading.</p>
        <br class="mobile-br">
        <h2>4. Choosing the Right Leverage for Your Trading Style</h2>
        <p>Different trading styles and strategies may benefit from different levels of leverage. Consider your trading goals, risk tolerance, and experience level when selecting an account type and corresponding leverage. Each account type is designed to support various trading needs and preferences.</p>
        <br class="mobile-br">
        <p>If you have any questions about leverage or need assistance in choosing the right account for your trading needs, feel free to contact our support team. We're here to help you make informed decisions and support your trading success.</p>
