        <h2>1. Payout Processing Time</h2>
        <p>Typically, payouts are processed within <strong>3 to 5 business days</strong> from the date your withdrawal request is approved. This timeframe allows us to ensure that all transactions are completed accurately and securely.</p>
        <br class="mobile-br">
        <h2>2. Factors Affecting Processing Time</h2>
        <p>Several factors can influence the processing time of your payout:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verification Status:</strong> Ensure your account details are fully verified to avoid delays. Incomplete or pending verification can extend processing times.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Method:</strong> The processing time can vary depending on the payment method you choose. For example, bank transfers may take longer compared to e-wallets or cryptocurrencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Volume:</strong> During periods of high transaction volume, such as market fluctuations or end-of-month spikes, processing times may be slightly longer.</li>
        </ul>
        <br class="mobile-br">
        <h2>3. Withdrawal Request Approval</h2>
        <p>To initiate a payout, you need to submit a withdrawal request through your account dashboard. Once submitted, your request will be reviewed and approved. Ensure that all information is correct and that you have met any minimum withdrawal requirements.</p>
        <br class="mobile-br">
        <h2>4. Contacting Support</h2>
        <p>If you experience any delays or have concerns about your payout, our support team is here to assist you. Contact us through our support channels for updates or to resolve any issues related to your payout request.</p>
        <br class="mobile-br">
